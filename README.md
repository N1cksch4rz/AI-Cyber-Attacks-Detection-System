# AI-Cyber-Attacks-Detection-System

**Overview**

Welcome to the Cyber Attack Detection with AI project. Our primary goal is to develop an advanced system that detects and mitigates cyber threats in real-time. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we leverage the power of machine learning to safeguard digital assets and protect sensitive information.

**Key Features**


Decision Tree and Random Forest: In our current iteration, we employ Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms for cyber attack detection. These models provide a strong foundation for identifying malicious activities within network traffic.
Scalable and Efficient: Our solution is designed to scale with the ever-increasing volume and complexity of network data. It operates efficiently, ensuring minimal false positives and swift response to threats.

**Future Updates**


Our commitment to enhancing cyber defense doesn't stop here. We have exciting plans for the project's future:

Deep Learning Integration: Our next major update will introduce Deep Learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to improve detection accuracy and extend our capabilities to recognize complex, previously unseen attack patterns.

User-friendly Interface: We're working on a user-friendly web-based interface to make it easier for security teams to visualize and manage threats, enabling better decision-making and rapid response.

Customization: We aim to provide customizable configurations, allowing users to tailor the system to their specific network and security needs.
